# Draft Manager
[![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/BrMacCath/DraftManager?include_prereleases&label=latest&logo=github&labelColor=green)](https://github.com/BrMacCath/DraftManager/releases)

This plugin is to help order writing drafts in Obsidian and how to manage the final product. This plugin will allow for different draft styles.

# What is the purpose of this plugin

I think Obisidian is a great tool to store notes and to writing but I found that having a vault for both purposes led to me getting overwhelmed. 


# Set up

## Name vaults

State the vaults that you wish to be able to transfer files to. Right now there is no method to check that the vault listed is a valid vault. If you try to move files to a vault that does not exist you will just get an error message. A gif to show how to add vaults is below.

## Make Default draft conditions

There is a selection of draft types that can be used with this plugin. Explanations of the draft styles are in the next section. 

### Go through each section

### File prep to use the draft conditions

# Moving Files

There are two methods of moving files in this plugin. They require that you set up which vaults you can move them to.

## Move entire folder using a command

If you want to move all the files within a folder without any changes, you can use a command to do do this. A gif is presented below.


# Draft Styles

## Blank

This draft style updates the frontmatter and adds the next draft number title to the page.

## Copy

This updates the frontmatter, states the completed draft version and creates the title for the next draft.

## Peterson-Walt-Frontmatter


# Move Type

# Attributions

I copied the obsidian Icon from the quickadd plugin.
I copied the file suggest from  Liam's Periodic Notes Plugin: https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes . I did change the input options for a few suggests but it was more of a copy and replace than a new idea.
